# .To-Do List Application (Website) Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project involves the development of a To-Do list application that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks. The application enables users to add new tasks by entering text into an input field and clicking the "Add" button, which will dynamically update the task list.

Each task can be marked as either "completed" or "incomplete" by simply clicking on the task name. A close icon will also be provided to allow users to remove specific tasks from the list, ensuring an organized and clutter-free task management experience.
